# Basic-Exfiltration-Over-Unencrypted-Obfuscated-Non-C2-Protocol
This is a basic example that I have played around in terms of moving data around in kali Linux and proving the completion with Wireshark
This is extremely beginner friendly and its just to get you the use of wireshark and to show its object export capabilities. 
Please let me know if I should do a different example using another open source tool 
if this aspect in wireshark is not really relevant for this kind of exfiltration method when going more in depth in terms of tool use.
